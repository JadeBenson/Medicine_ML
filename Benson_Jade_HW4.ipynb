    "In this homework, we are exploring the outputs of the Foundation Machine, GPT-J. We are able to query this algorithm with any question and receive a response based on multiple billions of files this algorithm was trained on. This is a cutting edge technology and many questions still remain about its accuracy and applications. We will attempt to contribute to this research by manually fact-checking the accuracy and developing a method to try to cross-reference the consistency across outputs.  "

    "\n",
    "Egemen was kind enough to discuss how this process can be automated and I think he has a great approach to this! I was hoping that an in-depth manual checking would be able to pick up on more details, but this is very time-consuming and difficult to judge exactly what is considered \"accurate,\" let alone within 5%. I'm taking this mainly as an opportunity to explore some of these issues in depth and think about how the Foundation machine might be answering these prompts"

This method was successfully applied to a pharmacokinetic study of aceclidine after intravenous administration to healthy male volunteers. The results indicated that aceclidine was rapidly eliminated with a half-life of approximately 1.27 h. No accumulation of aceclidine was observed after repeated administration. The developed method was fully validated and proved to be reliable and accurate for the determination of aceclidine in human plasma and urine.\n",

We observed that APRISO delayed the development of the prostate tumor and the appearance of distant metastases in a model of castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Interestingly, the administration of APRISO reduced the tumor burden in an orthotopic model of PCa. In addition, APRISO reduced the cell proliferation and the levels of expression of c-fos and cyclin D1 in vitro and in vivo. Finally, we found that the administration of APRISO reduced the expression of growth factors (FGF2 and VEGF) and the activation of the Akt and ERK signaling pathways in PCa cells.

AVC down-regulated the expression of cyclin D1, CDK2, MMP-2 and MMP-9. AVC also suppressed the expression of phosphorylated ERK and AKT. In addition, AVC reduced the protein expression of VEGF. These results indicated that AVC could suppress proliferation and migration of A549 cells by inhibiting the expression of VEGF and its downstream signaling pathways, and the mechanism of AVC might be related to down-regulating the expression of cyclin D1, CDK2, MMP-2 and MMP-9.\n",

This action of theophylline was inhibited by cyclic AMP-dependent protein kinase inhibitors, such as KT-5720 and H-8.

The development of B cells is regulated by the interplay between the extrinsic and intrinsic factors. During their development, the B cells are influenced by the various cytokines and chemokines produced by the microenvironment. It has been shown that B cells are attracted by the chemokines CCL19 and CCL21 expressed on the surface of the lymph node stromal cells.

We found that TS-overexpressing cells were less susceptible to 5-FU than control cells. However, the CAPE-induced sensitization of TS-overexpressing cells was much more pronounced than that of control cells. In addition, the sensitization of TS-overexpressing cells to 5-FU was abolished by the overexpression of TS. Finally, we showed that CAPE increased the expression of the TS mRNA, which was mediated by a transcriptional mechanism. These results suggest that the expression of TS is one of the determinants of the sensitivity of cancer cells to CAPE-induced apoptosis.\n",

SAH is a product of methylation reactions, and is normally converted to homocysteine by the enzyme SAHH. Homocysteine is then converted to methionine by the enzyme betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase. Inhibition of SAHH results in an accumulation of SAH, which inhibits methyltransferases, including the DNA methyltransferase DNMT1, leading to DNA hypomethylation. Because of the widespread effects of DNMT1 inhibition, the drug has been shown to cause genome-wide demethylation, growth arrest, and apoptosis in cancer cells.\n",

Nicholson et al., Cancer Res. 46: 1411-1416 (1986); A. J. Sladek et al., Biochem. Pharmacol. 35: 1067-1072 (1986); J. O. Anderson et al., Br. J. Cancer 59: 721-726 (1989); and D. W.

Sprouting involves the formation of new capillaries from pre-existing blood vessels. In intussusception, existing capillaries are projected into the tissue space previously occupied by the tumor.

Androgen ablation therapy has been the standard treatment for patients with metastatic prostate cancer. However, the effects of androgen ablation therapy on bone metabolism are not completely satisfactory. Citarinostatis is a new inhibitor of androgen-mediated bone metabolism, which is an effective drug for patients with prostate cancer and osteoporosis. It has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of osteoporosis and prostate cancer. It has been shown to reduce bone turnover and to prevent the progression of osteoporosis.

The process of acquiring resistance is a major impediment to the long-term use of existing drugs. To develop new drugs and new combinations of existing drugs, it is necessary to understand the biology of drug resistance. We have developed several in vitro and in vivo models to study the biology of drug resistance. The results of these studies have provided insights into the mechanisms of drug resistance, including mechanisms of acquired drug resistance. These mechanisms include: 1) Development of drug resistance by amplification of drug-efflux pumps; 2) Alteration of cellular drug metabolism by drug inactivation or increased metabolism of the drug; 3) Alteration of drug-target interactions by decreased drug-target binding or by alteration of the\n",

Here, we used a combination of in vitro and in vivo models to determine the effect of cytidine on DNA methylation and to investigate its mode of action. Our results showed that cytidine could reduce the overall methylation level of DNA by inhibiting DNA methyltransferase 1 and 3a. Additionally, we found that cytidine could increase the overall expression of DNA methylation-related genes and lead to the derepression of cancer-related genes, such as Wnt, Notch, and hedgehog signaling pathway genes. Finally, we demonstrated that cytidine could suppress the growth of human cancer cells in a nude mouse xenograft model.

Cytisine is a component of the French smokeless tobacco product \"Marlboro.\" It has been hypothesized that cytisine acts as a partial agonist at the 5-HT1A receptor, with the consequence that cytisine might induce antidepressant effects in smokers. We tested the hypothesis that cytisine has antidepressant effects in rats and the potential mechanisms of action. We administered cytisine to rats using the chronic mild stress model. We measured the concentrations of monoamine neurotransmitters in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, and examined the levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) in the hippocampus. In the forced swim test, rats treated with cytisine showed an antidepressant-like effect. In the chronic mild stress model, cytisine significantly decreased the concentrations of serotonin and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid\n",

In the body, glutamate is primarily produced by astrocytes and other glial cells, but neurons also make glutamate and release it as a neurotransmitter. Glutamate is released in response to nerve signals and is a major mediator of communication between the nervous system and the rest of the body. Glutamate is released in a controlled way, and the process of releasing it is called exocytosis. When glutamate is released, it causes nearby cells to become more or less excitable, which causes a response in the body. Glutamate is involved in a variety of functions, including the regulation of muscle contraction and maintenance of muscle tone, control of respiration, and production of the sensation of pain.\n",

The increased anabolic activity of insulin in the liver is the most important pathogenic factor in DKA. Insulin stimulates the breakdown of fatty acids, proteins, and glucose in the liver, and ketogenesis is the main hepatic metabolic pathway. During DKA, insulin's metabolic actions in the liver are excessive and ketogenesis is accelerated.

PKA phosphorylation of CREB leads to CREB activation, which can be assessed by increased CREB-mediated transcription of a reporter gene. Dibutyryl-cAMP was previously shown to activate CREB in several neuronal cell types, and we report here that it also activates CREB in neuroblastoma cells. In addition, dibutyryl-cAMP activates CREB in glial cells, and we show that it does so by a cAMP-independent mechanism.

When the drug is administered to a patient, the parent compound is converted to its active form, and then the active drug binds to DNA, where it interferes with DNA synthesis. Thus, if the active drug is not metabolized to its inactive form, it can only be activated at a site where DNA synthesis is occurring, such as in rapidly dividing cancer cells.\n",

It is a synthetic estrogen that acts by binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). Breast cancer cells have the ability to respond to the anti-estrogenic effects of endoxifen. The response to endoxifen differs in a tumor-specific manner. In particular, ER-positive tumors are relatively sensitive to endoxifen. ER-negative tumors are relatively resistant to endoxifen. This differential sensitivity to endoxifen makes it possible to treat ER-positive tumors with endoxifen and ER-negative tumors with tamoxifen.\n",

The specific aims of this project are: 1) to test the hypothesis that ethanolamine increases cyclic AMP and inhibits PKA, 2) to determine the role of cyclic AMP and PKA in ethanolamine-mediated inhibition of tumor cell proliferation, and 3) to determine the role of c-myc and p21W\n",

The effect of Etofibrate is most apparent in hypertriglyceridemia and in hypercholesterolemia. However, it also has beneficial effects in hypertriglyceridemia in which hyperlipidemia is due to increased production of triglyceride-rich lipoproteins (TRL) by the liver. TRL are very large lipoproteins which are removed from the blood by lipoprotein lipase (LPL) and are metabolized by the liver.

However, a subset of women with endometrial cancer will develop estrogen-independent tumors that do not respond to the drug. In contrast, some women who develop estrogen-independent breast cancer are treated with an aromatase inhibitor. It is unclear whether there is a genetic component to the sensitivity of breast and endometrial tumors to this drug. We propose to study the role of the estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRgamma) gene in the response of breast and endometrial cancer to this drug.

      "line 11734: Response: Guanidineis a drug that inhibits proliferation of most tumor cells. Inhibition of ribonucleotide reductase by 8-aminoguanosine, an inhibitor of the p53 tumor suppressor, results in accumulation of hypoxanthine and adenine nucleotides. Guanidine increases nucleotide pool levels, and promotes G1/S phase arrest in some cell lines. Guanidine also inhibits poly(ADP-ribose)polymerase (PARP), which, along with telomerase, are important for maintaining telomere length. It has been proposed that the inhibition of PARP is responsible for the anti-tumor activity of guanidine. We studied the effects of guanidine on the expression of p53 and its downstream targets. Guanidine decreased the steady state levels of p53, p21, and MDM2 in cell lines with wild-type p53. The half-life of p53 was also increased in cells\n",

We used organotypic hippocampal slice cultures, which contain neurons and glial cells. We found that idebenone decreased the amount of soluble amyloid-β (Aβ) peptides, tau protein phosphorylation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels in hippocampal slices exposed to Aβ.

It has also been implicated in the regulation of bone resorption, haemostasis, cell migration and inflammatory responses. In experimental models of EAE, quinimod has been shown to attenuate the progression of disease. The development of FPR-1 antagonism is currently being pursued for the treatment of a variety of disorders.\n",

To further characterize this compound, we investigated the effect of mavacamten on the induction of differentiation in neuroblastoma cells. We observed that mavacamten was a potent inducer of differentiation in N2a neuroblastoma cells, in a concentration-dependent manner, reaching a plateau at 2 microM. Induction of differentiation was observed with a time course of 12 hours, but not with a shorter incubation time. This induction was specific for neuronal differentiation, as evidenced by the expression of neuron-specific enolase, a neuronal specific marker. The process of differentiation induced by mavacamten was preceded by a short increase in the levels of phospho-Akt and phospho-ERK1/2. These changes in protein phosphorylation were also associated with a change in cell morphology. Indeed, the morphological transformation that occurs during the differentiation process was observed\n",

We have previously shown that methylis inhibits the expression of several key enzymes of the androgen-signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms by which this occurs are not well understood. Here, we show that methylis-induced inhibition of prostate cancer cell growth and androgen-dependent gene expression occurs in part through the down-regulation of the protein levels of androgen receptor (AR) and the steroid receptor coactivator-1 (SRC-1). Methylis inhibited the growth of prostate cancer cells in part through the down-regulation of the protein levels of AR and SRC-1. Methylis treatment resulted in a marked decrease in AR and SRC-1 protein levels.

This study also examined the efficacy of Morinis in combination with the oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor, imatinib. A human breast cancer cell line, MCF-7, was implanted into the mammary fat pad of female nude mice. Treatment of the mice with Morinis (100 mg/kg, twice daily, oral gavage) significantly decreased the tumor growth rate compared to the control group. In addition, the Morinis treatment significantly decreased the bone loss associated with the tumor burden. Morinis also significantly inhibited the bone resorption rate in the tumor-bearing mice.

Here, we demonstrate that mupirocin inhibits IL-1beta production by suppressing activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome in human monocytes. The expression of mupirocin-induced p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) was increased and p38 MAPK inhibition enhanced IL-1beta production. The production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation were enhanced by mupirocin treatment.

The influence of NMS-P937 on the expression of anti-apoptotic and pro-apoptotic proteins and on the DNA damage was also investigated. Cell viability was measured by the MTT assay, and the expression of apoptotic proteins was determined by Western blot analysis. The influence of NMS-P937 on DNA damage was determined by the comet assay. NMS-P937 inhibited HUVEC viability in a dose-dependent manner, as well as the expression of Bcl-2 protein, and increased the expression of Bax protein.

To date, the clinical development of NUTRESTOREis based on the use of APP and amyloid beta peptide (Aβ) to monitor the efficacy of the drug in AD patients. However, it is well known that APP is also cleaved by β-secretase at the position of the transmembrane domain, generating a soluble form of APP (sAPPβ) that has been shown to be an endogenous antagonist of Aβ neurotoxicity. It is not known if the pharmacological modulation of APP metabolism by NUTRESTORE could also affect sAPPβ metabolism. We have therefore investigated the effects of NUTRESTORE on the processing of APP in primary neuronal cultures. We demonstrate that NUTRESTORE induces the cleavage of APP at the β-secretase site by upregulating the expression of BACE1. We also demonstrate\n",

A possible mechanism of this interaction is presented, in which piperine inhibits the activity of the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP1A2 and CYP2C19, resulting in a decreased conversion of curcumin to the active metabolite (1-7-dichloro-4-hydroxy-2-methoxynaphthalene) and an increase in the bioavailability of curcumin.

This complication is unusual in the early phase of the treatment and is usually related to the use of an antiplatelet drug other than clopidogrel.

We found that overexpression of PAK1 in HCT116 colon cancer cells enhanced proliferation and suppressed senescence, whereas knockdown of PAK1 induced senescence and apoptosis. p21-induced apoptosis was blocked by inhibition of PAK1 in a p53-independent manner. In addition, we showed that treatment of HCT116 cells with FH535, a novel and selective PAK1 inhibitor, caused apoptosis and suppressed cell proliferation in vitro.

The drug has been withdrawn from the market in many countries because of its association with potentially fatal drug-induced QT prolongation, and the use of prophylactic ECG monitoring has been mandated in the USA. In recent years, it has become apparent that some drugs are capable of inducing an increase in I~Kr~ and a prolongation of the QT interval in patients.

Although it is unclear whether the lack of response was due to a loss of efficacy or drug resistance, the development of drug resistance is a major concern in the clinical application of POMi.

Here, we show that Raltegravir treatment enhances mitochondrial fission and decreases mitochondrial membrane potential in primary hippocampal neurons. Moreover, we show that the inhibition of mitochondrial fission by dominant negative Drp1 mutant blocks the anti-amyloidogenic effect of Raltegravir in the APP/PS1 mice model of Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that Raltegravir is a promising anti-amyloidogenic drug, and might have the potential to reduce amyloid burden in Alzheimer's disease.\n",

In cancer cells, S3003 inhibits growth and induces apoptosis, in part, by increasing expression of BIM, a pro-apoptotic member of the BCL-2 family of proteins. To determine whether this BIM induction is responsible for the apoptosis induced by S3003 in a subset of neuroblastoma cell lines, we treated NB-2a cells with S3003 and assessed BIM induction, cell death, and cell cycle effects. We found that, in contrast to other cell lines tested, S3003-induced apoptosis in NB-2a cells and that this apoptosis was accompanied by BIM induction. The NB-2a cells were more sensitive to S3003-induced apoptosis than other neuroblastoma cell lines. NB-2a cells are also sensitive to TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRA\n",

The effect of S3798 on B cell viability was tested in human B cell lines and primary human B cells. The mechanism of S3798-induced cell death was studied by measuring the activity of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and the release of mitochondrial cytochrome c. AIF was localized in the mitochondria of B cells and its release from mitochondria was blocked by S3798. However, cytochrome c release was not observed in B cells. The addition of AZT, which was reported to be associated with a defect in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, resulted in AIF release from the mitochondria and cytochrome c release.\n"

S3868is a potent inhibitor of T-cell proliferation, but the mechanisms underlying this effect are not known. We found that S3868inhibits T-cell activation in vitro by preventing nuclear translocation of NF-AT and by blocking IL-2 production. In vivo, S3868blocks activation-induced proliferation and IFN-gamma production in response to low doses of ovalbumin and in response to immunization with inactivated influenza virus. S3868treatment significantly inhibited the development of acute graft-versus-host disease in mice and prolonged survival in a model of acute GVHD.

We examined whether and how S4651 improves the contractile function of the left ventricle (LV) and whether it exerts its cardioprotective effect through the activation of mitochondrial adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production in isolated mouse hearts after global I/R injury. Isolated hearts were subjected to 20-min regional ischemia and 60-min reperfusion. Infarct size, LVDP, LVEDP, and functional recovery after I/R injury were evaluated.

Interestingly, S4810 had more obvious effects than rapamycin. This might be because of the combined effect of inhibiting the mTORC1 and mTORC2 signaling pathways. In contrast, metformin (20 mM) had no obvious effects on the phosphorylation of mTOR, p70S6K, and 4E-BP1. The mechanism of action of metformin is not completely understood.

At the same time, S4931 was found to promote the accumulation of FMDV RNA in the cells. However, S4931 did not affect the induction of IFN-β by FMDV infection. We also found that S4931 promoted the degradation of FMDV RNA, which was caused by the inhibition of the PKR-dependent phosphorylation of eIF2α, and this effect was not correlated with the dose of S4931 in the medium. Taken together, our results showed that the PKR-dependent phosphory\n",

Cell cycle analysis and annexin V/PI staining revealed that S4976 treatment resulted in accumulation of cells in the G0/G1 phase. In addition, expression of p21 and p27, two important CDK inhibitors, was induced by S4976. Furthermore, inhibition of CDK2 by RNA interference (RNAi) or CDK2 kinase activity by roscovitine significantly increased S4976-induced apoptosis.

In the current study, the authors examined the effects of S5015 on learning and memory in a novel object recognition task. The results of the behavioral experiments demonstrated that S5015 improved the memory deficits induced by Aβ1-42 oligomers. These effects were associated with a reduction in the formation of autophagosomes and a decrease in the number of cleaved caspase-3 positive cells in the hippocampus. However, these effects were not observed when the Aβ1-42 oligomers were injected into the dentate gyrus. This suggests that the therapeutic effect of S5015 is likely due to the activation of the autophagy-lysosome pathway in the dentate gyrus. In addition, S5015 also prevented the Aβ1-42 oligomers-induced reduction in dendritic spine density. Taken together, these results suggest that S5015 may have therapeutic\n",

In this study, the effect of S5034 on invasion and growth of human hepatoma cell line was investigated. We found that S5034 significantly inhibited invasion of Huh7 cells through Matrigel-coated membrane and that its growth was also suppressed. The anti-invasive effect of S5034 was due to inhibition of MMP-2 and MMP-9 activities and not due to cell proliferation inhibition. Furthermore, we observed that S5034 treatment reduced the activities of both MMP-2 and MMP-9, resulting in a significant inhibition of cancer cell invasion. In conclusion, S5034, a specific inhibitor of MMP-2 and MMP-9, has an anti-invasive effect on human hepatoma cells, which may be a promising agent for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma.\n",

A previous phase II trial showed that ticagrelor was non-inferior to clopidogrel in reducing cardiovascular events and was associated with a lower rate of major bleeding. A subsequent phase III trial demonstrated that the incidence of major bleeding was significantly lower with ticagrelor\n",

In this study, we demonstrated that PGE~2~ promotes tumorigenesis by inducing tumor cell proliferation and suppressing apoptosis in the early stage of gastric tumorigenesis. The suppressive effect of PGE~2~ on tumor progression in advanced stages is likely due to the induction of apoptosis.

In this work, we examined the thermal stability of the native TR in the presence of increasing concentrations of S5454 using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). In contrast to a previous report, we find that S5454 stabilizes the TR structure by reducing the unfolding transition temperature. The presence of S5454 stabilizes the secondary structure of TR, particularly the helix at the 3' end of the RNA. However, we also find that the affinity of S5454 for TR is very low and that S5454 has a low affinity for the native TR structure.

We used the cell line derived from the SW48 colon cancer cell line, which has a mutated form of p53 and a very high Aurora-B expression. Cells were exposed to 0.5 μM S5566 for 48 hours. We first measured the phosphorylation of histone H3 at Ser10 (H3S10ph) by Western blot, as this is a good marker of Aurora-B activity. Inhibition of Aurora-B was found to decrease H3S10ph (Fig. [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}A), in agreement with the literature. This suggests that S5566 inhibits Aurora-B in our cell line. We then checked the proliferation rate of the cells and found that it was not affected by S5566 (Fig. [1](#F1){ref-type=\"fig\"}B).\n",

The growth inhibitory effects of S5631 in human colorectal cancer cell lines were evaluated by the MTT assay. S5631 was shown to have a potent antitumor effect against all cell lines tested, with an IC50 value of 3.3 to 17.5 nmol/L. The antitumor activity of S5631 was superior to that of the Src inhibitor PP2, which was used as a positive control. The cytotoxicity of S5631 was concentration dependent and time dependent. The antitumor effect of S5631 was most prominent at a dose of 10 nmol/L, and the activity was more prominent at lower pH.

The results showed that S5633 increased the sensitivity of HNSCC cells to CDDP in vitro and in vivo. The mechanism of action of S5633 in HNSCC cells was associated with the inhibition of NF-κB signaling, down-regulation of NF-κB target genes, and inhibition of the PI3K/AKT pathway.

In this study, we examined the effect of a combination of this drug with radiation in two different models of pancreatic cancer, one of which was orthotopically xenografted into the pancreas of nude mice. Combination treatment with SAR125844 and radiation induced significant cell death in both xenografts and patient-derived tumor tissue. This effect was observed with doses of SAR125844 as low as 0.5 µM. The increase in radiation-induced cell death was accompanied by the inhibition of DNA repair, and was dependent on the radiation dose and the cell type. Moreover, we found that combination treatment with SAR125844 and radiation increased the radiosensitivity of tumors with low levels of KRAS expression. In addition, SAR125844\n",

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of T-705 and zidovudine (AZT) on cell survival in U937 cells infected with HIV-1. In this study, we have demonstrated that the combination of T-705 and AZT could decrease the viability of U937 cells infected with HIV-1. This decrease was due to the decrease in the cell cycle and apoptosis. We also found that the decrease in cell viability induced by T-705 and AZT was correlated with the decrease in HIV-1 expression. These results suggest that T-705 can be a potential alternative therapy to AZT for HIV-1 infected patients.\n",

The results were later replicated in a study in which mice were exposed to triclosan in drinking water for 28 days.

These results are consistent with a stimulatory effect of Ca2+ on the function of adrenergic receptors. In the present study, we found that isoproterenol stimulation of guinea-pig and rat myocardial adenylate cyclase activity is attenuated by the presence of 2 microM ryanodine. These results are consistent with the concept that an elevation of Ca2+ in the cytosol is required for stimulation of the enzyme. In the presence of 1 microM ryanodine, a drug which inhibits Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, isoproterenol stimulation of guinea-pig myocardial adenylate cyclase activity is enhanced.

It does this through reversibly blocking phosphorylation, which the responde does not answer.

Remarkably, it is pulling from a real article which is a phase III trial: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18188694/. This article even states that the most common adverse event was diarrhea, but does not mention that this lead to the discontinuation of lapatinib. The exact statistics that it cites (38% vs 17%) are not present in this article.

GPT-J seems to be correct about everything except the exact incidence of diarrhea and the number of clinical trials - but given its performance, this has me second-guessing that I may have just missed the studies it was drawing from. \n",

    "Overall, there is not a lot of consistent full information across the queries. There are many genes that do not have a corresponding drug attached to them and fewer drugs with patent information. Also the accuracy of any of these responses is not tested here. It is difficult to tell if this is a short-coming of GPT-J, the state of literature about gene/product/drug links, errors in my simple coding approach, or something else. "
